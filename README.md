 ### My Blog
 This is mainly a sandbox to play with some new web technologies.  Over a decade ago I got into web design - it was what brought me into working with technology in the first place.  Since that time however, I haven't come back to web design besides a few random instances.  Today I'd like to get some of the fundamentals that exist today down in my mind - namely HTML5, a little Javascript, JQuery, Web Fonts, SVG, Bootstrap, perhaps some Ruby, etc...
 Not all of this I can do with Github Pages, however I'm going to play with what I can here and then use Git to handle code versioning for the rest.  I've found the ability to revert to an old (working) copy invaluable as a learning tool.

 _Thus we begin..._
